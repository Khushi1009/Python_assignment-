        "Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n",
        "\n",
        "-Addition (+): Combines two numbers. Example: 5 + 3 results in 8.\n",
        "\n",
        "-Subtraction (-): Finds the difference between two numbers. Example: 10 - 4 results in 6.\n",
        "\n",
        "-Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers. Example: 2 * 5 results in 10.\n",
        "\n",
        "-Division (/): Divides one number by another, returning a floating-point result. Example: 10 / 2 results in 5.0.\n",
        "\n",
        "-Floor Division (//): Divides one number by another and truncates the result to an integer. Example: 10 // 3 results in 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "-Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of a division. Example: 10 % 3 results in 1.\n",
        "Exponentiation (**): Raises one number to the power of another. Example: 2 ** 3 results in 8.\n",

        "**2. Assignment Operators**\n",
        "These are used to assign values to variables and optionally perform operations while assigning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Basic assignment (=): Assigns a value to a variable. Example: x = 5.\n",

        "Combined operators like +=, -=, *=, and /= modify the variable in place. For instance, x += 2 is equivalent to x = x + 2.\n",

        "\n",
        "not: Negates a condition. Example: not (5 > 3) results in False.\n",

        "OR (|): Performs a bit-by-bit OR operation. Example: 5 | 3 (binary 101 | 011) results in 7.\n",
        "\n",
        "XOR (^): Performs a bit-by-bit exclusive OR operation. Example: 5 ^ 3 results in 6.\n",
        "\n",
        "NOT (~): Inverts the bits. Example: ~5 results in -6.\n",
        "\n",
        "Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits to the left. Example: 5 << 1 results in 10.\n",

        "Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits to the right. Example: 5 >> 1 results in 2.\n",
