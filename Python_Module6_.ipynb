        "**Abstraction**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Abstraction focuses on hiding the complexity of a system and exposing only the essential features relevant to the user.\n",

        "Single inheritance involves a child class inheriting from one parent class. This type of inheritance allows the child class to reuse the methods and attributes of the parent class. It is the simplest form of inheritance and is typically used when there is a straightforward relationship between two classes. For example, a Child class could inherit from a Parent class to extend or specialize its behavior. This promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy by centralizing common features in the parent class.\n",

        "**2. Multiple Inheritance**\n",

        "Multiple inheritance allows a child class to inherit from more than one parent class. This is useful when the child class needs to combine features or behaviors from multiple unrelated classes. However, it can introduce complexity, especially when methods with the same name exist in multiple parent classes. Python resolves such conflicts using the Method Resolution Order (MRO), which determines the sequence in which parent classes are searched for attributes or methods. For instance, a Child class might inherit from Parent1 and Parent2, gaining access to both sets of features.\n",

This type of inheritance models a hierarchical relationship where properties and methods are passed down the inheritance chain. It is useful for representing relationships with more than two levels. For example, a Grandchild class can inherit from a Parent class, which in turn inherits from a Grandparent class, allowing the Grandchild to access features from all levels.\n",

        "**4. Hierarchical Inheritance**\n",
        "\n",
        "In hierarchical inheritance, multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class. This is useful when different classes need to share common features or behaviors defined in the parent class. Each child class can also define its own unique attributes and methods in addition to those inherited. For instance, a Parent class might define general behavior, while Child1 and Child2 extend it in their specific ways. This promotes code reuse while allowing specialization.\n",

For example, a class might inherit from two parent classes (multiple inheritance) while also being part of a hierarchy. This type of inheritance is powerful but can lead to complications, such as ambiguity in method resolution, which is handled in Python through the MRO.
